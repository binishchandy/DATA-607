### Motivation
```
The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having 
sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property 
damage, and/or disruption to commerce. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that 
generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San 
Diego coastal area and other significant meteorological events, such as record 
maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with
another event.

By analyzing the storms events dataset, it can give shed some light on the most 
dangerous or likely event like coastal floods and waterspout caused by storm, 
it's impact etc...
