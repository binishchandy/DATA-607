```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(RCurl)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Read data from github
The data file is hosted in github.  
[Airline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binishkurian/DATA-607/master/week-04/flights.csv)
```{r}
url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binishkurian/DATA-607/master/week-04/flights.csv")
df <- read.csv(text = url, header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)
```

### Convert data frame to tibble
```{r}
flight_schedule <- as.tibble(df) 
flight_schedule
```

### Tidy data
```{r}
flight_schedule_tidy <-flight_schedule %>%
        gather('Los Angeles':Seattle, key = "destination", value = "flight_count") %>%
        spread(key = arrival, value = flight_count) %>%
        rename(on_time = `on time`)
flight_schedule_tidy
```

### Rank delays from least to maximum delayed across carriers and destination
```{r}
flight_schedule_tidy %>%
        mutate(
                perc_delayed = delayed / (delayed + on_time),
                delay_score = min_rank(perc_delayed)
        ) %>%
        arrange(delay_score)
```
```
AM WEST's service to San Francisco has most delayed flights.
```

### Box plots of delays to check outliers
```{r}
boxplot(flight_schedule_tidy[flight_schedule_tidy$carrier == "ALASKA", ]$delayed)      
boxplot(flight_schedule_tidy[flight_schedule_tidy$carrier == "AM WEST", ]$delayed) 
```

### Compare delays between airlines
```{r}
flight_schedule_tidy %>%
        group_by(carrier) %>%
        summarise(
                count = n(),
                mean = mean(delayed, na.rm = TRUE), 
                sd = sd(delayed, na.rm = TRUE),
                median = median(delayed, na.rm = TRUE),
                iqr = IQR(delayed, na.rm = TRUE),
                abs_dev = mad(delayed, na.rm = TRUE),
                min = min(delayed, na.rm = TRUE),
                max = max(delayed, na.rm = TRUE)
                )
```

### Conclusion
```
Since both airline data have a outlier, median and IQR are more robust than
mean and sd. Following the table above, ALASKA has median of 62 flights and 
IQR of 82 and AM WEST has median of 117 flights and IQR of 64. This makes me to 
conclude that ALASKA has better control on their flight delays.
